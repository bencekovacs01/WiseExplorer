# OpenRouteService API Configuration
# Get your free API key from: https://openrouteservice.org/dev/#/signup
ORS_KEY=your_openrouteservice_api_key_here

# HTTPS Development Configuration
# For local HTTPS development, you need SSL certificates
# The following files should be present in the project root:
# - server.cert (SSL certificate)
# - server.key (SSL private key)
# 
# To generate self-signed certificates for development:
# openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout server.key -out server.cert -days 365 -nodes
#
# Note: Self-signed certificates will show browser warnings in development
# but are sufficient for local testing and mobile device access over HTTPS

# Next.js Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://localhost:3000

# Optional: Database Configuration (if using external database)
# DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string

# Optional: Additional API Keys
